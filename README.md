# Natours NodeJS Application (WIP)

My own development (and completed work) on the Natours project, available as an (extensive) course @[Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-express-mongodb-bootcamp/) and originally created by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann), thank you ðŸ‘‹.

The application is built using recent developments in the web-app eco-system including:

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - TBC
2. [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - TBC
3. [MongoDB, Mongoose and friends](https://www.mongodb.com/developer/languages/javascript/getting-started-with-mongodb-and-mongoose/) - TBC
4. [Pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) - for swift prototyping and rendering, server-side, of UI components
5. [JWT, jsonwebtoken](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken), [Crypto](https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html), [Helmet](https://helmetjs.github.io/#get-started) - for secure server-side (API) login and app content security
6. TBC

A small amount of client-side development was included:

1. Login - axios
2. Alerts - TBC
3. MapBox - (served from a CDN, owing to bundler related issues alongside Parcel)
4. ...
