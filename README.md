# Natours NodeJS Application

My own development (and completed work) on the Natours project, available as an (extensive) course @[Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-express-mongodb-bootcamp/) and originally created by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann), thank you ðŸ‘‹.

The application is built using recent developments in the web-app eco-system including:

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - TBC
3. [MongoDB, Mongoose and friends](https://www.mongodb.com/developer/languages/javascript/getting-started-with-mongodb-and-mongoose/)
4. [Pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) - for swift prototyping and rendering, server-side, of UI components
5. [JWT, jsonwebtoken](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken), [Crypto](https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html), [Helmet](https://helmetjs.github.io/#get-started) and [cors](https://github.com/expressjs/cors#readme)- for secure server-side (API) login, app content security and integrity.
6. Other areas included:
   - rate limiting
   - compression
   - route protection etc.
7. API development and design using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)

A small amount of client-side development was included:

1. Login / Update Profile / Reset Password- [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) (via CDN)
2. Browser Alerts
3. Online maps [MapBoxBox](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/guides/) - (again via CDN, owing to bundler related issues alongside Parcel)
4. Payments (FinTech) with [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/api?lang=node) checkout integration (via CDN)
5. SMTP (e)mail integration and testing with [Mailtrap](https://mailtrap.io/home), [Mailsac](https://mailsac.com/) and [SendGrid](https://docs.sendgrid.com/api-reference/how-to-use-the-sendgrid-v3-api/).

Honor statement: This is entirely my own work and has not been copied verbatim or lifted from a ChatGPT (or similar).
